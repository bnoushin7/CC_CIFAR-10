# CIFAR-10 Image Classification in TensorFlow

[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is a labeled datasetcontaining  60,000  images.  It  contains  ten  classes:  airplane,  automobile,  bird,  cat,  deer,dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.  Each class contains exactly 6,000 images in which the dominantobject  in  the  image  is  of  that  class.  The  classes  are  completely  mutually  exclusive.  There  is  nooverlap  between  automobiles  and  trucks.  For  instance,  Automobile  includes  sedans,  SUVs,  andother small vehicles while Truck includes bigger trucks.  Neither includes pickup trucks.  The restof this report is organized as follows. 

This project implements a thee layer convolutional neural network to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset using the TensorFlow.
